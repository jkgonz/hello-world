Let´s see where this takes us. Perhaps to fulfilling our dreams of game design. Up to this point we haven´t made any progress due to some speed bumps in the road but hopefully with some free time, a pc and the desire and will we possess, this will change. Here´s to trying new and interesting things. Cross your fingers, knock and wood and inspite of obstacles, let´s move forward. In with the positive and out with the negative. Let´s do this!
